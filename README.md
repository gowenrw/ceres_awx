# ceres_awx
AWX server provisioning for local and cloud

The goal of this project is to build three distinct AWX environments to cover dev, qa, and prod use cases.

*  DEV - AWX in a single VM on a local machine (Virtualbox hypervisor provisioned with Vagrant).
*  QA - AWX in a single IaaS VM and some PaaS services on Microsoft Azure.
*  PROD - AWX fully distributed IaaS/PaaS environment on Microsoft Azure.

## My local environment

*  Host OS: Windows 10
*  VirtualBox version 7.0.6
*  Vagrant version 2.3.4
